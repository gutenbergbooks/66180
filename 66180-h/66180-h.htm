<hr class="r5" />
<p>In introducing this volume to the Public, the Author would simply
remark, that it was written at different periods of a college life, which
has just expired; (the Scripture Sketches at a very early part of it.)
He has no intention of screening its faults, either of feeling or style,
beneath his ‘score of summers;’ but as prefaces are the fashion, he
has thought the mention of the fact would not be amiss in the promotion
of a proper understanding between himself and his readers.</p>

    <div class="verse indent2">Morn breaketh in the east. The purple clouds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are putting on their gold and violet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To look the meeter for the sun’s bright coming.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sleep is upon the waters and the wind;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And nature, from the tremulous forest leaf</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To her majestic master, sleeps. As yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is no mist upon the deep blue sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the clear dew is on the blushing bosoms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of crimson roses, in a holy rest.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How hallowed is the hour of morning! meet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aye, beautifully meet, for the pure prayer.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">The patriarch standeth at his tented door,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With his white locks uncovered. ’Tis his wont</div>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">To gaze upon the gorgeous orient;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And at that hour the awful majesty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of one who talketh often with his God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is wont to come again and clothe his brow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As at his fourscore strength. But now he seemeth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be forgetful of his vigorous frame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And boweth to his staff as at the hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of noontide sultriness; and that bright sun!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He looketh at its pencilled messengers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Coming in golden raiment, as if light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were opening a fearful scroll in heaven.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah! he is waiting till it herald in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hour to sacrifice his much loved son!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Light poureth on the world. And Sarah stands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Watching the steps of Abraham and her child</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Along the dewy sides of the far hills,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And praying that her sunny boy faint not.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would she have watched their path so silently,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If she had known that he was going up,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even in his fair-haired beauty, to be slain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As a white lamb for sacrifice? They trod</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Together onward, patriarch and child;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bright sun throwing back the old man’s shade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In straight and fair proportions, as of one</div>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Erect in early vigor. He stood up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Firm in his better strength, and like a tree</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rooted in Lebanon, his frame bent not.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His thin, white hairs had yielded to the wind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And left his brow uncovered; and his face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Impressed with the stern majesty of grief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nerved to a solemn duty, now stood forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a rent rock, submissive, yet sublime.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the young boy, he of the laughing eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ruby lip, the pride of life was on him.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He seemed to drink the morning. Sun and dew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the aroma of the spicy trees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all that giveth the delicious East</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its fitness for an Eden, stole like light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into his spirit, ravishing his thoughts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With love and beauty. Every thing he met,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Floating or beautiful, the lightest wing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of bird or insect, or the palest dye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the fresh flowers, won him from his path;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And joyously broke forth his tiny shout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As he flung back his silken hair, and sprung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Away to some green spot or clustering vine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To pluck his infant trophies. Every tree</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And fragrant shrub was a new hiding-place,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he would crouch till the old man came by,</div>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then bound before him with his childish laugh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stealing a look behind him playfully,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To see if he had made his father smile.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">The sun rode on in heaven. The dew stole up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a light veil from nature, and the heat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came like a sleep upon the delicate leaves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bent them with the blossoms to their dreams.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still trod the patriarch on with that same step,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Firm and unfaltering, turning not aside</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To seek the olive shades, or lave his lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the sweet waters of the Syrian wells,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose gush hath so much music. Weariness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stole on the gentle boy, and he forgot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To toss his sunny hair from off his brow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And spring for the light wings and gaudy flowers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As in the early morning; but he kept</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Close by his father’s side, and bent his head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon his bosom like a drooping bud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lifting it not, save now and then to steal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A look up to the face whose sternness awed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His childishness to silence.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">It was noon;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Abraham on Moriah bowed himself,</div>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And buried up his face, and prayed for strength.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He could not look upon his son and pray;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But with his hand upon the clustering curls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the fair, kneeling boy, he prayed that God</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would nerve him for that hour. Oh! man was made</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the stern conflict. In a mother’s love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is more tenderness; the thousand cords</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Woven with every fibre of her heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Complain, like delicate harp strings, at a breath;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But love in man is one deep principle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which, yielding not to lighter influence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Abides the tempest. He rose up, and laid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wood upon the altar. All was done.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He stood a moment, and a vivid flush</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Passed o’er his countenance; and then he nerved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His spirit with a bitter strength, and spoke:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Isaac! my only son!’ The boy looked up,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Abraham turned his face away, and wept.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Where is the lamb, my father?’ Oh! the tones,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sweet, the thrilling music of a child!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How it doth agonize at such an hour!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was the last, deep struggle. Abraham held</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His loved, his beautiful, his only son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And lifted up his arm, and called on God&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And lo! God’s Angel stayed him; and he fell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon his face and wept.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">They gathered round him on the fresh green bank,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The last faint gleam had vanished, and the wood</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">In a low tone to his few followers,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Who laughed forever like the birds and had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long eyelashes and very dangerous eyes,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I was in love; but it seemed natural</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To think of all she said, and she’d a way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of coming to one’s dreams; and then her name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was always in the lesson like a word,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And half the time I studied it. This eve</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We had been very gay, and I had watched</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The deep, half shaded dimple in her cheek,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till I forgot to answer; and as she</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of too much mirth grew serious, I began</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To act the lover playfully. My cap</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was carelessly thrown back, and on my cheek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I shook some dew for tears, and as she curled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her lip in mimic scorn, I knelt to her,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And begged for her sweet favor, touchingly.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She answered coldly first, and then relented,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As wiser maids have done; but with a look</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of something so like earnest, that I did</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her hand some violence; and then she blushed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And said I must not tell, but ladies’ lips,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By some, were counted prettier.

    <div class="verse indent0">It was a gentle eve in Hindoostan.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rains were past, and the delighted earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was beautiful once more, and glittering leaves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were lifting lightly on their beaten stems,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent28">Meina stood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the breathing carpet of the shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gazing on sky and river. There was much</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the dark features of the young Hindoo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That should have won a gentler history.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She had the Eastern eye, with its dark fringe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shadowy depth of lustre; but, beyond</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The elements of beauty, there was writ</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A something that the wounded roe would trust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For shelter from its hunters. Her closed lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were delicate as the tinted pencilling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of veins upon a flower; and on her cheek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The timid blood had faintly melted through,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like something that was half afraid of light.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There was no slighter print upon the grass</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than her elastic step; and in her frame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There was a perfect symmetry, that seemed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aerial as a bird’s. It was the hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For worship in her land; and she had come,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the religion of a high, pure heart,</div>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">To bow herself in prayer. A darker mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might pray at such an hour; but she had caught</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The spirit of the scene; and, as her eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Followed the coursing of the golden waves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or rested on the clouds that slept above,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like isles upon the bosom of the sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her soul was swept to music like a harp,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And she knelt down in her deep blessedness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To worship the High Maker. As she prayed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her beautiful young boy&mdash;a very dream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As he might be, of infant loveliness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With his dark hair upon the summer wind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the sweet laugh of a delighted child</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like music on his lips&mdash;came leaping by,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, flinging a light wreath upon her brow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sprang onward like a bounding antelope.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She turned a moment&mdash;might she not, for him?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Him, whom she cradled in the whispering tree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And gathered to her bosom in the hush</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the still night?&mdash;to know if he was there.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Twas but a moment, and she bowed again;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, as the murmur of her silver tone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stole out upon the wind, her images</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of majesty came back, and she was filled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a deep channel by the whirlwind swept,</div>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Again with the rich rushing of her prayer.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The shadows of the stealthy evening came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Silently on; but she was up, in thought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among the crystal palaces of light;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a still prompting came to her, to pray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the poor spirit of a passing world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With all its fond, but frail idolatries,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might on the altar of her God be flung.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She breathed it, and along the holy shore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She heard the whisper of the waters creep:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Thine is the victory, Meina!’&mdash;Was it won?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Won in its cold, bereaving cruelty?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Won from the pride of woman? from her love?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Won from thy boy! young mother? No! oh, no!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She had forgotten him! He was too young,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too purely, beautifully young, to die!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then the waves repeated to the shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the light echo heard it: ‘Give him up!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Meina heard it: ‘Give him to thy God!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the strong heart arose! One arrowy pulse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of an acuter agony than death;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One fearful shiver at the searching thrill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And she had won&mdash;aye, with her glorious boy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon her very breast&mdash;the victory!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">‘Come! Come!’ and he was bounding airily</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beside his stately mother, laughing out</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His lisping prattle of the promised boat,</div>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if her words had been in playfulness,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The morning mist stole up, as Meina knelt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To offer him to God. Her eyes were dim;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But her fine forehead, and her calm, still lip,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were fearfully subdued; and as the cloud</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which clothes the lightning slumbers, so they slept.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her soul was in its strength. She held her boy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon her bosom, till she felt the throb</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of his warm pulses numbered on her heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And her low, leaden cadences, kept on!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His silken hair, as delicately soft</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As the light wind that stirred it, floated up,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if to plead at her transparent cheek;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But she had wooed its kisses till it came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be a fond idolatry, and now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She nerved her as the strong heart answered it.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the low words broke severally on,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">There is a period in the wreck of hopes</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">With the stern conflict ever, and awaits</div>

      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And it is strange, how a weak human heart</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">The low ‘Amen!’ died on the silent air,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Meina’s heart was ready. The young boy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sprang joyously away, as if her arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had prisoned him too long; and, as he saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The painted boat heave lightly to the swell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the reedy shore, and caught the breath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of her wreathed helm of flowers, he gave a shout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In his impatient gladness, and away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a warm vision of aerial birth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He bounded to implore that she would come.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Calmly and steadily came Meina on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Led by her victim boy. The boat was there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among the tall wet reeds, and she went in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And scanned its light frame over, and arranged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its mimic ornaments; and then again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When she had seen it all, and he had grown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Impatient, she began to note once more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The frailties in its lightly plaited reeds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if she did not know that it was meant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To kill. It is a wonderful effect</div>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of nature in the heart, that in the strength</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of a mistaken duty, it will turn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And almost trifle with its tenderness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if it half misgave that all was wrong.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">‘Come!’ and he sprang into his mother’s arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a light leap, and, scarcely faltering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In his gay laugh, he looked into her face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in a tone of fondness whispered her,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Will the boat bear, dear mother?’ She had quelled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her feelings until now; had nerved herself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the light grace with which he bounded by;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had heard his voice, and looked upon his hair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In its light, breezy floatings, and had shut</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her heart up, with an iron thought, to all.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But this one doubt, half sadness as it came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From his delighted lips, and with his look</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of childlike and appealing confidence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was keener than a mother’s heart could bear!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She bowed her head, and struggled, as if life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were bursting from its seal; and, as the thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rushed over her to take her idol back,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And keep him for her God, he murmured low,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘And are you sure, my mother?’&mdash;‘No! my son!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the strong tide of nature gathered back</div>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a resistless energy. She clasped</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her boy convulsively, and he had lived</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To quicken, in its gifted elements,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The radiant spirit written on his brow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But a high strengthening she knew not of,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awakened her, and pressing down her lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a long fervent kiss upon his cheek,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She hushed him into peace, and lifting up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her face to heaven, she breathed the name of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And laid him down&mdash;for ever!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent28">The light bark</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Went smoothly with the tide, and floated on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till his dark eye was scarcely visible.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On, and yet on, she bounded! The bright waves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seemed playful in their leaping joyousness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the curled ripple feathered at the prow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a glad thing of life. Had death grown slow?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or were the waters ‘stayed,’ that they should keep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their cold embraces from him? On, still on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With her quick undulations! Hope revived</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the sick heart of Meina, and she rose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To gaze more keenly forward. He was there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And his small arms were lifted; and she thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That, as he tossed them upward, she could hear</div>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">A cadence of his sweet and silvery voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a delighted shouting. It died off,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then again she heard it. Was it joy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That broke upon her ear? oh! was there joy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In that long cry, thou mother? Hark to it!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis like the arrowy piercing of the wind!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He moveth, and she bade him to be still!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He riseth! ’tis his boyish restlessness!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Look, Meina! Does he dash his little hands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In mirth, upon the waters? Hark! once more!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Mother!’ He calls thee! Is thy child afraid?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Again! How very fearfully it comes!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Help! Mother!’ ’Tis a cry of agony!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He sinks! Fly! Fly! he calls to thee! Oh fly!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Mother!’ God help thee! Dost thou see him now?</div>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
